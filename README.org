* Clean audio files

A small, throw-away project to clean unwanted snippets from an audio
file. Wrapped nicely in a container and sugar coated with a justfile
for easy operation.

** Usage
#+begin_src shell
  # build the container
  just build
  # remove unwanted snippets from an audio file
  just run audiofile.wav
  # clean up the container
  just clean
#+end_src
